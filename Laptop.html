                                With up to a 10th-generation quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is ready to take on even the toughest tasks. So when you're powering through pro‑level processing jobs like compiling code, layering multiple tracks in a music composition or encoding video, you'll get everything done faster.

                                <dd>If you’re looking for some mind-blowing generational technological advancement, the new 13-inch MacBook Pro is not for you. But if you’re looking for a laptop that’s undergone some necessary, incremental improvements, then you’re in the right place. The $1,799 MacBook Pro offers solid performance, a lighting-quick SSD and Apple’s ever elegant design. Plus, the company has closed the chapter on the Butterfly keyboard, bringing the fantastic Magic keyboard to the mix. Plus, you get double the storage. It’s not the jaw-dropping change you want, but the experience elevating change that MacBook fans need. </dd>
                                <br />

                                <dt>Mac Book Pro Design</dt>
                                <dd>Call it a game of deja vu. The latest MacBook Pro looks exactly like its predecessor, which is fine. Although I was hoping for somewhat of a change, like thinner bezels or new colors. But no, the MacBook retains the elegant, familiar looks of the previous notebooks. You have your all-aluminum Space Gray chassis that is also available in Silver.Open the laptop and you're greeted by the massive Force Trackpad, which sits directly below the keyboard. Above that, you’ll find the Touch Bar with the power button/Touch ID to the far right. And speaking of the keyboard, it’s been replaced with the Magic keyboard, closing the chapter on the Butterfly keyboard (more on that later).</dd>

                                <dd>Apple knows how to make a pretty screen, which is why every system, including this one, has a 2560 x 1600-pixel Retina display. The 13.3-inch panel is beautiful on its own, but like other modern MacBooks, this Pro has True Tone, a utility that, when enabled, automatically adjusts the color temperature based on the environment so you can enjoy optimal hues whether you’re in natural or fluorescent lighting or in a darkened room.

                                When I watched the trailer for Bad Trip, I was enraptured by the Pepto Bismol pink Ford Taurus actor Erik Andre was working on. Details were sharp enough that I could see the individual sparks flying as he placed the jumper cables on the wrong portion of the car’s engine. </dd>

                                <dd>It’s not the six booming speakers on the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but this 13-inch notebook can get plenty loud. My small living/dining room was filled with warm, balanced audio when I listened to Tony! Toni! Tone! play “Whatever You Want.” The bass was rich, the synths were measured, the drums were nice and crisp, and the vocals floated gently through it all.</dd>

                                <dd>So, about that keyboard. After vocal consumer complaints, Apple has finally parted ways with the uncomfortable Butterfly keyboard in favor of the Magic Keyboard. It’s clicky with firm feedback, making for a very comfortable typing experience. I cruised past my typical 70 words-per-minute typing average on the 10fastfingers test, reaching 76 wpm.As expected, the MacBook is outfitted with a massive Force trackpad. At 4.4 x 2.6 inches, I never had to worry about running out of space to navigate. And although my palms inadvertently came in contact with the trackpad, the cursor maintained its position thanks to the excellent palm rejection. The edges of the trackpad have firm feedback when you’re right or left-clicking.

                                <dd>The MacBook Pro is armed with a 2-GHz Intel Core i5-1030NG7 processor with 16GB of RAM. The laptop chewed through 30 open tabs of Google Chrome while I watched Black Butler on Netflix.

                                  The laptop fared pretty well on our synthetic benchmarks. When we ran the Geekbench 5.0 test, an overall performance benchmark, the MacBook achieved 4,399, sailing past the 4,171 premium laptop average. It also beat the Spectre and its Core i7-1065G7 CPU, which scored 4,074. However, it was no match for the XPS 13 (Core i7-1065G7 CPU), which hit 4,648. 

                                  During the Handbrake video transcoding test, the MacBook turned a 4K video to 1080p in 12 minutes and 43 seconds. It was much faster than the 18:52 average. The XPS 13 was a close second at 15:40, while the Spectre completed the task in 21:13. That’s impressive since both the Dell and the HP have Core i7 processors compared with the MacBook’s Core i5 CPU.

                                <dd>The MacBook Pro delivers all-day performance, lasting 10 hours and 21 minutes on the Laptop Mag Battery Test (continuous web surfing over Wi-Fi at 150 nits of brightness). That’s longer than the 9:05 premium laptop average. However, it’s nowhere near as long as the XPS 13 and Spectre, which clocked times of 12:39 and 13:19, respectively..</dd>

                                <dt>Mac OS CATALINA</dt>
                                <dd>Like most modern MacBooks, the Pro runs on macOS Catalina. In the interest of unification, Apple has killed iTunes in favor of Music, Podcasts and TV. The interface is iTunes-reminiscent with the navigation menu on the left, controls at the top, and the content in list/icon form on the rest of the screen. In practice, it’s a very smooth experience. And while I’m not a big Safari user, I like what Catalina brings to the table. It helps you avoid opening redundant tabs and assists in creating stronger passwords. The new tab screen now shows iCloud tabs and Siri Suggestions. System Preferences has been retooled to fit all of your Apple ID information, allowing you to manage your connected devices, contact info, password and more.

                                One thing I’ll always appreciate about macOS is the lack of bloatware. Outside of essentials like Safari, Photos and the App Store, you’re not going to see much flotsam. 

                                The MacBook Pro comes with a 1-year limited warranty. See how Apple fared in Tech Support Showdown and Best and Worst Brands, our annual special reports.

                                            Unlike 2018 models, the Macbook Pro 13 in it latest July 2019 release, covers all its cons which includes a fast quad core i5 processor, touch ID, touch bar which adds a cool factor to otherwise a simple laptop, new design butterfly keyboard which is now more tactile, and more. I was waiting for this release and as soon as it was launched on amazon, I ordered it.
                                            I got the delivery next day which is impressive as the croma store was also taking one day for delivery and was not offering any discount, priman was giving back to school discount of 4.5% but it was asking 4-5 days for delivery.
                                            Regarding the review, you can watch youtube videos on it where they show how fast is this Macbook Pro compared to the previous generations, even faster than some 15 inch ones.
                                            I have been a windows user and one thing I noticed with macOS is that it is simple, straight forward and fast. I heard a lot about the track pad on Macbooks and it was yet a new discovery for me moving from windows. The gestures are very intuitive and easy to adapt. I still use a windows laptop alongside Macbook and its track pad always leaves me wanting for more.
                                            The screen is vibrant and color accurate but not as punchy as an OLED or a 4k display. True tone is a useful feature specially if you use your computer for long hours. Speakers are unmatched and you wont miss you headphones if you forgot to carry them on your trip. One thing i experienced with this Macbook is that it feels heavy compared to its size.
                                            Now the battery is what amazed me. I can't keep my windows laptop and its charger separated for long but this Macbook has crazy long battery life. If you leave your Macbook lid closed overnight, the battery will just drop by one or two percent at max.
                                            Overall I paid for an experience and till now I am having a good one. Only thing I feel that 1.34lac is still a high price for this laptop. But hey, the price is an entry barrier and if you like exclusive things then this Macbook is for you.

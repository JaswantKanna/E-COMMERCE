      <h3 class="my-3">Product Description</h3>
      <p>About Rolex Watches. Wearing a Rolex watch enables entry into a world of unlimited possibilities. Rolex's story began when founder Hans Wilsdorf created the first waterproof wristwatch – the Oyster – and developed into a range of timepieces that have become icons of watchmaking.

      <h3 class="my-3">Product Details</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Specificaton:</li>
        <p>As its name suggests, the Submariner is a diver’s watch. Ever since its inception in 1953, it has remained a classic favourite among Rolex lovers. A part of the Oyster Perpetual line, the Submariner Date easily catches one’s eye given its robust and functional looks.</p>
        <li>Design</li>
        <p>The oyster case is designed with a distinctive green dial and luminescent hour markers with a Chromalight display that provides luminosity for about eight hours. The 40mm unidirectional rotatable bezel with 60-minute graduations coated in platinum is the key feature of the watch. Made exclusively by Rolex and known as the Cerachrom bezel, it’s crafted out of a hard, corrosion resistant ceramic. If you take a closer look, you’ll realise that the bezel is knurled on the edges. This helps provide excellent grip under water, even if you are wearing diving gloves. The movement of the watch is another feather of Rolex’s cap. The Calibre 3135, a self-winding mechanical movement is developed and created entirely by Rolex and is a certified Superlative Chronometer. Fitted with a Parachrom hairspring and offering great resistance to shocks and temperature variations, the Calibre 3135 movement provides accuracy in timekeeping.

        Wrapped in Rolex’s signature oyster bracelet made of 904L steel, the Submariner is equipped with an Oysterlock clasp (to prevent accidental opening) and Glidelock technology (to allow adjustments without using any tools). With umpteen useful features and a Triplock winding crown that ensures water resistance to depths of 1,000 feet, this is truly a watch lover’s treasure.</p>
        <li>Water Resistant</li>
        <p>Many people associate Rolex with reliability, robustness, accuracy, and perfection.

        Today, most people also expect a Rolex watch to be water-resistant, and the fact is that all Rolex watches actually are water-resistant.

        It is widely known that Rolex has been to some extreme and demanding places. Rolex watches have been brought to the lowest lows and the highest highs, 


        For a watch to be truly reliable in extreme conditions, it needs to be water-resistant. And while watches that offer hundreds of meters of water-resistance, will, in most cases never be brought to these depths, the high water-resistance is a testimony to the extreme outer factors, such as water, and the pressure of water, that a watch can handle.

        With Rolex’s vision of perfection in mind, you can expect that Rolex has gone to great lengths to improve each and every aspect of their watches. One of those aspects that play an important role is the watches’ water-resistance.</p>
        <li>Five Year Guarantee</li>
